This is a simple Tic Tac Toe game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Players take turns marking X or O in a 3x3 grid, and the first player to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of their mark wins the game.

The game board and marks are styled using CSS to provide a visually appealing experience. The background of the game board has a radial gradient effect, creating a vibrant look.

## JavaScript Implementation

The JavaScript code handles the game logic, including keeping track of turns, checking for a win or draw, and displaying the appropriate message when the game ends. It also adds event listeners to the cells to handle player clicks and updates the game board's appearance based on the current turn.
